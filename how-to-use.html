        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">1. Setting Up the Ace Dash Camera</h3>
        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
            After installing the Ace dash camera, connect it to your vehicle's power source. Ensure that the camera is positioned correctly for an optimal view of the road. Once powered on, the system will automatically start recording.

        <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
            Use the "Camera Feed" section on your dashboard to view live footage or review recorded videos. You can stream footage directly from the Ace dashboard for real-time monitoring of your vehicle's surroundings.
